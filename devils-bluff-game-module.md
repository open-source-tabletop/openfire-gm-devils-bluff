**Devils Bluff**
================

Devils Bluff is a Wild West Skirmish Module for the Open Fire system.

You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

**Section 1 - The Setting**
===========================

<!-- 

Devil's Bluff is set in a fictional corner of the real wild west called Devil's Bluff where players will form a crew around a leader character. Each crew has a home base which can earn them money, must manage their standing with the law, and compete with other players for overall control of Devil's Bluff.

-->

**Section 2 - Module Rules**
============================

<!--

Main change to the rules is to switch to using a deck of cards in place of a standard D12 for most mechanics, and having a hand which allows players to control the outcome of certain actions.

Also includes a rule for horses, they make the player faster and can ride someone down, but are less manoeuvrable and lower your battle skill. In addition taking damage on a horse can cause you to get thrown.

**Section 3 - Creating Your Crew**
==================================

<!--

How to put together a crew. Players create a leader then hire some guns. Most guns are not too different in stats but a range of abilities make them more interesting.

-->

**Section 4 - Campaign Rules**
==============================

<!--

Need to look into best way to manage this, something like kill team spec ops. Gangs get better as they play.
