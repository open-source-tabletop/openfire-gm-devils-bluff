# Introduction

Devils Bluff is a skirmish game set in a fictional wild west town and its surrounding areas. Players will build a gang of up to 10 gunslingers, growing in skill and reputation as players play in more and more games, until one player gains complete control of the town of Devils Bluff.

Devils bluff makes use of a deck of playing cards in place of standard 12 sided dice, and players can build a strong hand of cards to control the outcome of important events throughout the game.

# The Town of Devils Bluff

There's money to be made in a town like Devils Bluff especially for those willing to take it. Unscrupulous individuals see a chance to take control, to build an empire, and make a name for themselves, but there's always plenty of competition.

On the other hand, for every ruthless would be gang leader there is an honest person who would see the rule of Law win out. To overcome the rising outlaw menace they will need to fight twice as hard and be twice as ruthless.

Whether you choose to fight for wealth and reputation or to see justice done upon these dangerous gangs, either way, a reckoning is coming.

# The Draw

Instead of 12 sided dice, Devils Bluff uses a standard deck of playing cards to determine the outcome of actions. A standard 52 card deck (with all jokers removed) is shuffled and placed within reach of both players, this is called the **Draw Deck**. Cards which are discarded are placed in a pile face up next to the draw deck called the **Discard Pile**.

Any time the players would be required to roll a dice instead they draw, taking the top card from the draw deck and take its face value as the result, then discarding the card. Aces have a value of 1, Jacks are 11, Queens are 12 and Kings have a value of 13. A King does not trigger a critical success, a critical success only happens when a player plays their hand.

Any time a card is required to be drawn but the draw deck is empty, simply shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw deck.

# The Hand

During a game of Devils Bluff players will have a hand of up to 5 cards which they can use to influence the outcome of actions. At the start of each new round, after initiative has been determined, each player discards any cards still in their hands and the player that won the initiative draw deals all the players 5 new cards.

During the round, each time it is a player's turn to activate a model they may also draw a new card, they may do this even if they have no more models to activate so long as the other player still has models to activate. If a player already has 5 cards in their hand when they draw a new card they must immediately discard one of the cards that was already in their hand.

# Playing Your Hand

When a player makes an attribute test, instead of drawing a card as normal, they can instead play a set of cards from their hand to force a critical success.

The player declares they will play their hand instead of drawing and lays their entire hand face down in front of them. After they play their hand, in initiative order, any other player can also play their hand face down. Once all players have had an opportunity to play their hand the players simultaneously reveal their hands.

If the current player is the only player that plays a hand of cards, and they play a valid hand, then the action is an automatic critical success, if it is not a valid hand it is a failure.

If other players also play their hand then the player's hand must beat all the other hands played. For example if a player has three of a kind in their hand, this would beat two pairs or one pair and so on.

Once all players have finished playing their hands and the outcome has been determined, all the hands that were played are discarded.

Allowed hands of cards and their ranks (from lowest ranked to highest):

## One Pair

The hand contains two cards of the same face value. The highest value of the pair wins a tie.

## Two Pairs

The hand contains two pairs of cards with the same face value. The highest value of either pair wins ties.

## Three of a Kind

The hand contains three cards with the same face value. The highest value three of a kind wins ties

## Straight

A running sequence of 5 cards, regardless of suit. The highest value card in the straight wins ties.

## Flush

When all five cards in a hand are of the same suit, but not necessarily in any sequence, it is a flush. The highest value card in a flush wins ties.

## Full House

When a player has three of a kind and a pair in the same hand, it is called a Full House. The highest card in the hand wins ties.

## Four of a Kind

4 cards of the same face value. The highest value four of a kind wins ties.

## Straight Flush

Five consecutive cards, all from the same suit. The highest value card wins ties.

## Royal Flush

Five cards of the same suit: 10, J, Q, K and A. Even in the unlikely event of 2 players having a royal flush, this hand is an automatic critical success.

### **Section 3 - Creating Your Gang**
---

Each player in Devils Bluff will build a gang of up to 10 gunslingers.

## Creating a Gang for a Campaign

If you are playing a campaign you will need to create a roster for your gang and start by creating your Gang Leader. In your first game you will then be able to hire up to 9 gunslingers to join you in your first game.

After each game one hired gunslinger may join your gang permanently and gain experience which will enhance their skills. As you progress you will create a more elite gang with which to fight your battles.

To begin creating your gang add a Gang Leader to your roster which then gains 1 level of experience (see the section on Experience). You then choose 1 weapon from the weapon list for them to be equipped with.

## Creating a Gang for a One-Off Game

If you are playing a one off game you will create a gang leader and 2 custom gunslingers, hiring the remaining 7 before playing your game.

The Gang Leader gains 4 levels of experience, one custom gunslinger gains 3, and the other gains 2. You then choose 1 weapon from the weapon list for each of them to be equipped with.

| Gunslinger  | 5   | 9   | 7   | 8   | 8   | -             |

# Experience

As models take part in fights they gain experience and become more skilled. At the end of each battle you will determine if any permanent model in you gang gains an experience level. No model may gain more than 4 levels of experience and you should track this on your roster, taking note of any perks or abilities and modifying their attributes as necessary.

Each time you gain an experience level you may choose 1 perk to improve your models abilities. A single perk may not be taken twice on any given model.

Once a model reaches gains a third experience level they may also choose one ability and add this to their profile. You may not have more than 3 models with abilities in your gang and may not take the same ability as any other model in your gang.

## Abilities

Abilities are special rules which apply to a model whenever they make a critical success when making a **Battle Skill** test.

### Hail of Fire

When this model has a critical success on a **Battle Skill test**, after it has finished its attack action it may immediately make two more free attack actions with the same weapon.

### Precise Shot

When this model has a critical success on a **Battle Skill Test** that attack gains +3 DMG and +3 PRC.

### Return Fire

When this model has a critical success on a **Defence Test** then all hits from the attack that triggered the test are discarded and it may make an immediate free attack action against the model that was attacking it. The free attack cannot be evaded and gains a +3 modifier to the **Battle Skill Test**.

### Run and Gun

When this model has a critical success on a **Battle Skill Test** it gains +1 DMG and the model may immediately discard any suppression tokens it has and make a free Advance action.

### Shrug it Off

When this model has a critical success on a **Command Test** you may discard suppression tokens from every model in your gang. In addition this model regains 3 HP up to its original value.

# Hiring Gunslingers

There are 2 methods for hiring gunslingers to join your gang and you should choose whichever suits your miniatures collection best.

## Hiring Pool

If you have the miniatures available you should create a pool of at least as many gunslingers as would be required to fill both players gangs. If you do not have enough to make each gang have 10 miniatures you should ensure that there is enough to ensure each player will have the same number of hired gunslingers.

Before starting the game players should roll-off then, starting with the player that rolled the highest, players should alternate selecting one model from the pool to join their gang. Players should continue doing this until each gang has 10 models or there are no more models in the pool. The model will have whichever weapon is depicted on the model, or a revolver if they are not shown holding any weapon.

## Controlled Choice

If each player has their own selection of miniatures they may choose any model they wish to join their gang. However, they must have at least 5 models in their gang armed with revolvers.
