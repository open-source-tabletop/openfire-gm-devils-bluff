## Introduction

Devils Bluff is a skirmish game set in a fictional wild west town and its surrounding areas. Players will build a gang of up to 10 gunslingers, growing in skill and reputation as players play in more and more games, until one player gains complete control of the town of Devils Bluff.

Devils bluff makes use of a deck of playing cards in place of standard 12 sided dice, and players can build a strong hand of cards to control the outcome of important events throughout the game.

## The Town of Devils Bluff

There's money to be made in a town like Devils Bluff especially for those willing to take it. Unscrupulous individuals see a chance to take control, to build an empire, and make a name for themselves, but there's always plenty of competition.

On the other hand, for every ruthless would be gang leader there is an honest person who would see the rule of Law win out. To overcome the rising outlaw menace they will need to fight twice as hard and be twice as ruthless.

Whether you choose to fight for wealth and reputation or to see justice done upon these dangerous gangs, either way, a reckoning is coming.

## The Draw

Instead of 12 sided dice, Devils Bluff uses a standard deck of playing cards to determine the outcome of actions. A standard 52 card deck (with all jokers removed) is shuffled and placed within reach of both players, this is called the **Draw Deck**. Cards which are discarded are placed in a pile face up next to the draw deck called the **Discard Pile**.

Any time the players would be required to roll a dice instead they draw, taking the top card from the draw deck and take its face value as the result, then discarding the card. Aces have a value of 1, Jacks are 11, Queens are 12 and Kings have a value of 13. A King does not trigger a critical success, a critical success only happens when a player plays their hand.

Any time a card is required to be drawn but the draw deck is empty, simply shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw deck.

## The Hand

During a game of Devils Bluff players will have a hand of up to 5 cards which they can use to influence the outcome of actions. At the start of each new round, after initiative has been determined, each player discards any cards still in their hands and the player that won the initiative draw deals all the players 5 new cards.

During the round, each time it is a player's turn to activate a model they may also draw a new card, they may do this even if they have no more models to activate so long as the other player still has models to activate. If a player already has 5 cards in their hand when they draw a new card they must immediately discard one of the cards that was already in their hand.

## Playing Your Hand

When a player makes an attribute test, instead of drawing a card as normal, they can instead play a set of cards from their hand to force a critical success.

The player declares they will play their hand instead of drawing and lays their entire hand face down in front of them. After they play their hand, in initiative order, any other player can also play their hand face down. Once all players have had an opportunity to play their hand the players simultaneously reveal their hands.

If the current player is the only player that plays a hand of cards, and they play a valid hand, then the action is an automatic critical success, if it is not a valid hand it is a failure.

If other players also play their hand then the player's hand must beat all the other hands played. For example if a player has three of a kind in their hand, this would beat two pairs or one pair and so on.

Once all players have finished playing their hands and the outcome has been determined, all the hands that were played are discarded.

Allowed hands of cards and their ranks (from lowest ranked to highest):

### One Pair

The hand contains two cards of the same face value. The highest value of the pair wins a tie.

### Two Pairs

The hand contains two pairs of cards with the same face value. The highest value of either pair wins ties.

### Three of a Kind

The hand contains three cards with the same face value. The highest value three of a kind wins ties

### Straight

A running sequence of 5 cards, regardless of suit. The highest value card in the straight wins ties.

### Flush

When all five cards in a hand are of the same suit, but not necessarily in any sequence, it is a flush. The highest value card in a flush wins ties.

### Full House

When a player has three of a kind and a pair in the same hand, it is called a Full House. The highest card in the hand wins ties.

### Four of a Kind

4 cards of the same face value. The highest value four of a kind wins ties.

### Straight Flush

Five consecutive cards, all from the same suit. The highest value card wins ties.

### Royal Flush

Five cards of the same suit: 10, J, Q, K and A. Even in the unlikely event of 2 players having a royal flush, this hand is an automatic critical success.
