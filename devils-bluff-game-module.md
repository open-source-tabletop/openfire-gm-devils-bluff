**Devils Bluff**
================

Devils Bluff is a Wild West Skirmish Module for the Open Fire system.

You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

**Section 1 - The Setting**
===========================

<!-- 

Devil's Bluff is set in a fictional corner of the real wild west called Devil's Bluff where players will form a crew around a leader character. Each crew has a home base which can earn them money, must manage their standing with the law, and compete with other players for overall control of Devil's Bluff.

Most folks came out west looking for something, maybe a chance at a new life, new opportunity, maybe work the land and raise some cattle and a family. The town of Barton's Bluff was founded by a group of settlers along a tributary of the Salt River, Arizona, named for the bluff that runs along the south edge of the town. The land was ideal for farmers and ranchers which brought people, while coal and timber from the north brought wealth to the town.

While those that settled Barton's Bluff had been looking for a new life of freedom, there were those that travelled to the west looking for something else: money. Greedy land owners, unscrupulous business men, outlaws, gamblers, thieves and hired guns all found there way to the out of the way town, where it was all too easy to simply take what they want.

How he persuaded them to come no one is sure but each of them did, a meeting was held on a Sunday in the small church that sat at the end of the bluff, overlooking the winding river below.

============================

<!--

Main change to the rules is to switch to using a deck of cards in place of a standard D12 for most mechanics, and having a hand which allows players to control the outcome of certain actions.

Also includes a rule for horses, they make the player faster and can ride someone down, but are less manoeuvrable and lower your battle skill. In addition taking damage on a horse can cause you to get thrown.
