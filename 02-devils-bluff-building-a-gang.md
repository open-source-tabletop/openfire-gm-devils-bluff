Each player in Devils Bluff will build a gang of up to 10 gunslingers.

## Creating a Gang for a Campaign

If you are playing a campaign you will need to create a roster for your gang and start by creating your Gang Leader. In your first game you will then be able to hire up to 9 gunslingers to join you in your first game.

After each game one hired gunslinger may join your gang permanently and gain experience which will enhance their skills. As you progress you will create a more elite gang with which to fight your battles.

To begin creating your gang add a Gang Leader to your roster which then gains 1 level of experience (see the section on Experience). You then choose 1 weapon from the weapon list for them to be equipped with.

## Creating a Gang for a One-Off Game

If you are playing a one off game you will create a gang leader and 2 custom gunslingers, hiring the remaining 7 before playing your game.

The Gang Leader gains 4 levels of experience, one custom gunslinger gains 3, and the other gains 2. You then choose 1 weapon from the weapon list for each of them to be equipped with.

# Experience

As models take part in fights they gain experience and become more skilled. At the end of each battle you will determine if any permanent model in you gang gains an experience level. No model may gain more than 4 levels of experience and you should track this on your roster, taking note of any perks or abilities and modifying their attributes as necessary.

Each time you gain an experience level you may choose 1 perk to improve your models abilities. A single perk may not be taken twice on any given model.

Once a model reaches gains a third experience level they may also choose one ability and add this to their profile. You may not have more than 3 models with abilities in your gang and may not take the same ability as any other model in your gang.

### Precise Shot

### Return Fire

When this model has a critical success on a **Defence Test** then all hits from the attack that triggered the test are discarded and it may make an immediate free attack action against the model that was attacking it. The free attack cannot be evaded and gains a +3 modifier to the **Battle Skill Test**.

# Hiring Gunslingers

There are 2 methods for hiring gunslingers to join your gang and you should choose whichever suits your miniatures collection best.

## Hiring Pool

If you have the miniatures available you should create a pool of at least as many gunslingers as would be required to fill both players gangs. If you do not have enough to make each gang have 10 miniatures you should ensure that there is enough to ensure each player will have the same number of hired gunslingers.

Before starting the game players should roll-off then, starting with the player that rolled the highest, players should alternate selecting one model from the pool to join their gang. Players should continue doing this until each gang has 10 models or there are no more models in the pool. The model will have whichever weapon is depicted on the model, or a revolver if they are not shown holding any weapon.

## Controlled Choice

If each player has their own selection of miniatures they may choose any model they wish to join their gang. However, they must have at least 5 models in their gang armed with revolvers.
